<p>Any information submitted via the bar is saved to a cookie on <em>your</em> computer and is not saved anywhere on my server.  You're welcome to type anything you like, if you choose to type anything at all.  If you do enter anything, it is used only to personalize your experience across my websites, and my websites <em>only</em>.  You can delete the cookie at any time.</p>
<p>This site includes Google Analytics tracking code, so you might want to brush up on Google's privacy policy.  I do not collect any personally-identifiable information via the Analytics tracking.</p>
<p>If you like, you may opt out of being tracked via Google Analytics by clicking the link below.  This sets a cookie that my site's software checks prior to loading pages, and determines whether or not the tracking code should be included in the page.  If you choose to opt out of being tracked, be aware that this applies only to the main area of this website and does not apply to any subdomains (such as The Philosophy of Nate).  The option is offered out of respect for anyone who may be more security/privacy conscious and who prefers not to be tracked online.  The reason I use analytics is because I am interested in a broad picture of who visits me online.</p>
<p>If you're looking for an all-encompassing solution to "opting out" of being tracked online, look into browser plugins such as Ghostery, which blocks most trackers.</p>
