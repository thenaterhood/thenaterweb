<p>This website uses cookies in order to keep track of individual settings, rather than storing them on my server. Cookies are small pieces of information that websites store with your browser in order to hold preferences and other information. This website uses cookies in order to remember the name you enter and your preferences for tracking. At any time, you may choose to delete these cookies from your computer. Cookies set by this website expire after a month.</p>
<p>Any information submitted via the introduction bar is saved to a cookie on <em>your</em> computer and is not saved anywhere on my server.  You're welcome to type anything you like, if you choose to type anything at all. This information is used only to personalize your experience across my websites and my websites only and is not shared or used to track visitors. My server does not retrieve or store this information for any reason other than generating personalized pages to display on your browser.</p>
<p>This site includes Google Analytics tracking code, so you might want to brush up on Google's privacy policy.  I do not collect any personally-identifiable information via the Analytics tracking. I use Analytics to get what amounts to a fairly broad picture of what content on my site gets visited and how often. If you prefer, you may opt out of being tracked via Google Analytics by clicking the link at the bottom of the page. This sets a cookie that my site's software checks prior to loading pages, and determines whether the Analytics tracking is included in the pages. Be aware that I can only guarantee the functionality of this on the main areas of my website, and external sites and subdomains of my site may not provide the option to opt out. You can verify that you've opted out of being tracked on my websites by the statement "Your visit is not being tracked" shown at the top of the page. If you're looking for an all-encompassing solution to "opting out" of being tracked online, look into browser plugins such as Ghostery, which block most trackers as you browse the Internet.</p>
