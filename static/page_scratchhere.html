<p>So, you wanted a scratch and sniff feature.  I was totally going to build one too, but I don't know enough interactive web languages to make that happen.  Maybe, maybe in the future it'll happen.  For now, have a picture of Trex trying to make snow angels (credit: <a href='http://trextrying.tumblr.com'>trextrying.tumblr.com</a>).  Now that you're here, why don't you check out the rest of the site ;) ?  If you want to take a look at the shiny new experimental blog platform I'm building, you'll want to go to <a href='/blog'>www.thenaterhood.com/blog</a>, which is NOT the same as the site link, since the new one is still slightly a secret.</p>
<p>If you're looking to test the new platform, you can introduce yourself to the site with the name "tester" which will flip the navigation link at the top to point to the new platform rather than blogger.  If you want to do that, <a href="/?id=scratchhere&name=tester">click here</a>.  You can change your name later on the privacy page, link at the very top.</p>
<p>At this point, the majority of the user side of things is up and running.  Comments will be added via disqus once blogger is redirecting (at which point existing comments are going to get migrated over), search is on the way, as well as some other various small fixes.  Constructive criticism is welcome for anything on it, especially if something doesn't work right, and you can Facebook it to me or email me via the address on the <a href='?id=connect'>Connect page</a>.  All the posts that I intend to migrate have been pulled over from blogger at this point and date back to 2009 when I first started my tech blog.</p>
<p>On the technical side if you're interested, the entire site is built on roughly 1500 (no exact count right now) lines of code of object-oriented PHP.  For now, I'm keeping my code under wraps (at least until I pull all the thenaterhood.com specific things out), though in the future it may show up on github.</p>
<p>There are easter eggs around. They're well hidden, but they exist. They may not be the most awesome easter eggs, but hey, it's still fun to stumble on them right?</p>
