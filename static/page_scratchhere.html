<p>So, you wanted a scratch and sniff feature.  I was totally going to build one too, but I don't know enough interactive web languages to make that happen.  Maybe, maybe in the future it'll happen.  For now, have a picture of Trex trying to make snow angels (credit: <a href='http://trextrying.tumblr.com'>trextrying.tumblr.com</a>).  Now that you're here, why don't you check out the rest of the site ;) ?  If you want to take a look at the shiny new experimental blog platform I'm building, you'll want to go to <a href='/blog'>www.thenaterhood.com/blog</a>, which is NOT the same as the site link, since the new one is still slightly a secret.</p>
