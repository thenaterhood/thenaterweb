<p>So, you wanted a scratch and sniff feature.  I was totally going to build one too, but I don't know enough interactive web languages to make that happen.  Maybe, maybe in the future it'll happen.</p>
<h1>So, what powers this website?</h1>
<p>The site is powered by a PHP engine called gnat that is developed entirely in-house. Gnat is written entirely in object-oriented PHP and includes a blog platform, web administration system, and basic website engine. As of the time of writing, Gnat is version v1.10.1 (semantic versioning) and contains over 2852 lines of PHP and 14 classes, spread over about 40 PHP files. It is the result of nearly a year of development, which is still continuing.</p>
<h1>How did Gnat come about?</h1>
<p>Gnat grew out of an initial interest in learning PHP and web development as I found my basic HTML knowledge was less than adequate of its own accord for building anything larger than a fairly small website. Initially, it was intended to drive the main part of my site while other sections, such as my blog, were hosted on other dedicated services. I found that Blogger was no longer suiting my needs, and I set out on a separate project to build myself a better blog platform, wondering what I could come up with in 2 hours and with no more than 8 functions. I succeeded, although the platform has become much more complex and featureful since then. The beginnings of Gnat were merged with the new blog platform and The Philosophy of Nate was migrated from Blogger to my own platform.</p>
<p>Gnat is designed around several principles:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Simplicity and minimalism</li>
	<li>Flexibility</li>
	<li>Thorough documentation</li>
	<li>Good performance</li>
</ul>
<p>Gnat is designed to, as a PHP engine, be as simple to use and integrate into pages as possible. It contains configuration files, which allows for centralized changes to settings and features that can be applied site-wide quickly, and the configuration files - as well as the PHP internals - are documented thoroughly.</p>

<p>Additionally, in order to keep the platform as simple as possible and allow it to work without a database, it does not use a database. Rather, it relies on json or plaintext files to store blog posts and simple html/php files to store pages, all of which it maintains an index of for searching as efficiently as possible. This makes Gnat best suited for running small to medium sized websites, although the engine is capable of managing fairly large amounts of data, which results in degraded performance for initially generating indexes and feeds. Despite this, the test environment on a very underpowered server is capable of generating an index and feed of over 850 blog posts from scratch in under 30 seconds - a task that would ideally be required only once, as these are updated dynamically and not regenerated. Although Gnat does not use a database, managing indexes and feeds is generally abstracted out into two dedicated classes, so modifying the engine to use a database rather than a file should be fairly simple.</p>

<h1>I'm Interested, Where can I Get It?</h1>
<p>For now, the source of Gnat isn't freely available until I decide on the best licensing for the code. Right now Gnat powers my personal website (which you're on) and my RIT student page. If you're interested in using Gnat or looking at the source, get in touch with me and we can work something out.</p>
