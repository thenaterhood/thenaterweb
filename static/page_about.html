<p>I am an RIT software engineering student, and am self-taught in a number of programming languages including Java, PHP, Python, Bash, TI-Basic, and HCS12 Assembly at the time of writing this page.  More often than not I'm in the process of learning another language for the latest project I'm working on. As would probably be expected, all of my computers are a mix of various applications I've written myself to make my life a little easier and my computer a little more useful. Additionally, I have spent time as a lab administrator for a video production and CAD in my local school district, a position that involved managing student files, software configurations, and application data, over the district network. Although I am constantly immersed in a number of personal projects at any given time, I enjoy sharing my knowledge and abilities as well as working on a team to collaborate on problems of all contexts, ranging from technological problems to event planning.  Professionally, I have collaborated with local advertising agencies as a consultant for social media, website design and development, and marketing campaigns for various organizations.  I live for learning new skills inside and outside of my field and as such I have a wide variety of interests which range from long distance running to network security.</p>
