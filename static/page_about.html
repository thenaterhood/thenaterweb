<h1>Who I Am</h1>
<p>I am an RIT Software Engineering (SE) student, and I am knowledgeable in a number of programming languages including Java, PHP, Python, Bash, TI-Basic, and HCS12 Assembly at the time of writing this page. I enjoy learning, so more often than not I'm in the process of picking up new languages or new styles of programming, and am in the process of learning Scala and some principles of functional programming. As would probably be expected, my computer is a conglomerate of software I've written for my own purposes to make my life a little easier and my computer a little more useful. Although a fair number of my projects are run solely by me, I enjoy working on a team to solve problems of all contexts and am involved in several collaborative projects that are currently under wraps.</p>
<p>I enjoy learning and as such I have a wide variety of interests both inside and outside of my field, and am always searching for something new to try. I'm involved with a number of activities on and off campus that illustrate the diversity of my personality well. My involvements range from the RIT Linux Users' Group (RITlug) to Scouting, to horticulture.</p>

<h1>What I Do</h1>
<p>In the world of software I enjoy taking on new projects to implement new ideas and to build new alternatives to existing applications. My website and blog, for example, are powered entirely by a web engine and html template built by me in an effort to gain more control over how visitors interact with my site. Additionally, I delve into some minor hardware development, usually based around the Raspberry Pi. Many of my projects are published on Github at <a href='https://github.com/thenaterhood'>https://github.com/thenaterhood</a>.</p>
<p>In the past, I have collaborated with other people to administer to certain aspects of a video production and CAD lab in my local school district and worked with local advertising agencies as a consultant for social media and basic web development and usability. I have also taken courses in Information Security, so I have a very basic background in security and policy writing.</p>
<p>Outside of my field, I am an avid reader and writer, and spend time writing both code and literature. I run long distance and recently hit my 300 mile mark since I've started formally tracking my distances - my running stats can be found on <a href='http://runkeeper.com/user/thenaterhood'>runkeeper.com/user/thenaterhood</a>. Additionally, I am an adult volunteer for my local Boy Scout troop time permitting, and I am president of the RIT Linux Users' Group.</p>
