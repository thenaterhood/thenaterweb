<h2>Hello again, <?php print "$first_name"; ?>!</h2>
<div id="greeting_spacer"></div>
<div style="height:2px;"></div>
<p >I'm Nate, or as most of the Internet knows me, "TheNaterhood."  I am a computer engineering student at RIT so as you can probably guess, I'm pretty interested in all things computers.  I write a tech blog, <em>The Philosophy of Nate</em>, maintain my own website, and write software.  Some of my less nerdy hobbies are long distance running, casual gaming, and camping.</p>
<p >I am fluent in a number of programming languages including Python, and PHP which powers the main part of my website.  I also do a lot of cross-platform programming because I spend time in both Linux and Windows environments.  I developed websites and moderated social communities and advertising professionally alongside my own online presence for some time before I started college.</p>
<p >If you happen to be interested in getting in touch with me and you are a human who can solve CAPTCHAS, my email is listed in the "Connect" section of the sidebar.  If you're looking for other ways to get in touch or you want to find out more about me, I recommend looking at my LinkedIn profile which is also over in the sidebar.</p>
<p>Nice meeting you, <?php print "$first_name"; ?>.</p>
